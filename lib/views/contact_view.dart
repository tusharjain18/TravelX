The history of Alipore Zoo Garden dates back to as early as 1842, when the curator of Bengal Asiatic Society, Dr John McCleland came up with a plan for the establishment of the zoological garden in Calcutta. However, this did not materialize and was followed by the plan of Dr. Joseph Bart Fayrer (the president of Asiatic Society of Bengal) in 1867. This plan drew great public attention but failed due to a lack of space. For the same reason the plan of Carl Louise Schwendler, the postmaster to the Govt. of India failed in 1873. At last, in 1875 the Lt. Govt. of Bengal Sir Richard Temple took the initiative. The land on Alipore Road was chosen and approved leading to opening gates to the public on 1st May, 1876.",
